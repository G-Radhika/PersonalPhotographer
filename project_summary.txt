'Personal Photographer' is a voice controlled photo assistant application developed using google home frameworks. 
I have build this as a fun project to take family portraits without having someone manually operating the camera and
best part is no family member has to be left out. Also, I would like to learn API.AI, cloud vision API's for vision processing.

I started with API.AI google framework to train voice commands and relay the action commands to this nodejs server controlling 
the camera. After the picture is taken, used cloud vision API for 'face detection' available from Google and IBM.
